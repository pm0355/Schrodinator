I don't know how much experience you have with java but its fairly easy here is a quick crash on how to run a java file on a windows pc. You should already have java installed on your pc if not go to oracle’s website navigate to downloads, popular downloads, then java for your computer and download the latest version of java. If you want download the developer’s version so you program yourself. You’ll need into run eclipse which you can read about below.

There are two ways one involves downloading eclipse, which is really helpful software for programming and/or you can run it from the command line. Both have their benefits, its up to you!

1. If you have not already downloaded eclipse do so. You can edit java and compile and run programs within the application. Download then open the file with the program.

2. If not just use the built in cmd line. Place the file in a directory and follow the following instructions to compile.
	
	First type the following cmd into the command line, where 'mywork' is your directory of choice.
	- C:\> cd \mywork
	
	Then type in the following.
	- C:\mywork> javac schrodinator
	- C:\mywork> java schrodinaotr
	
	this should run the program.

The Shrodinator will generate even and odd solution Amplitudes, alpha, mass, energy, and fundamental quantum number based off a given set of inputs.
